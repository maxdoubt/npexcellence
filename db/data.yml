    - "Through our Bridge Builders program we unite and inspire diverse young people
      to become confident and courageous leaders. Our philosophy is that youth deserve
      to be respected and acknowledged for the positive difference they can make in
      Memphis. In the course of a year, we impact 6,000 students in 144 schools and
      in 57 zip codes.\r\n\r\nSome people think that because we're a social service
      agency, we target under-served youth.  In fact, the point of Bridge Builders
      is to bring together youth from all walks of life to get to know one another
      and appreciate what they have in common and how they may think differently."
    - 'When I came to BRIDGES I was challenged by the business challenges: clarity
      of focus and mission,creating the strategy, building a sustainable business
      and finanical model, etc. However, working with the youth and watching them
      evole into leaders has been the most gratifying. I’ve had an opportunity to
      coach some of our youth and it was really inspiring. Throughout my career I
      hadn’t had much interaction with youth in large numbers. Our youth really are
      amazing; adults need to think of them as an asset to the community.'
    - 'I am most proud of the Bridge Builders CHANGE program. CHANGE brings 24 students
      together to study social problems in Memphis, particularly as it relates to
      youth, because there are lots of issues that youth identify in schools and in
      the community that adults might miss. Youth are best equipped to identify youth
      problems and they work together to analyze the problem and develop a strategy
      for creating grassroots change. Instead of one-time volunteer service projects,
      this is a year-long project that addresses much more systemic issues. BRIDGES
      is unique in that it’s all about youth leading other youth: we believe that
      once you equip them with good practices and methodologies, they can figure out
      what to do and act on it. For example, through this program, our Bridge Builders
      recommended a policy to the Shelby County Schools Board of Education to establish
      a student congress so that youth voice could be heard. They lobbied every member
      of the school board and worked closely with the administration to develop the
      policy. The policy recommendation was passed and now the Bridge Builders working
      to make sure it’s implemented.'
    - We received an amazing challenge grant of $10 million to match with $10 million,
      creativng a $20 million  endowment, ensuring BRIDGES will never go away and
      that it will always serve the youth in the Memphis area... We are in the home
      stretch and we would love people to consider donating to the matching grant
      so we can reach our goal very soon!
    - ''
    - "We love all of the professional development opportunities through the Alliance
      that are unique to non-profit work. I personally enjoy the CEO round tables
      because I get the opportunity to interact with my fellow CEOs. When we get together,
      we compare notes about challenges we have and talk about best practices. It’s
      a great opportunity to seek advice from colleagues who have had similar experiences.\r\n\r\nIt’s
      a great resource for inexpensive and effective trainings and great networking
      opportunities for your entire staff. Our CFO and Vice President of HR both enjoy
      participating in their networking groups."

      class="timeline-body"><p>Founded as the Grant Information Center in 1992 to
      bring national funding to Memphis to leverage local giving. Lucia Gilliland,
      Governor Ned McWherter&rsquo;s Representative in West TN, founded the Center,
      along with Gid Smith, President of the Community Foundation and Harry Shaw,
      President of United Way. Initial services included training,grant writing and
      research (through a pool of grant writers). Seed funding was provided by the
      Plough Foundation, United Way Venture Fund, and the Memphis Rotary Club. The
      City of Memphis, Division of Housing and Community Development, contracted with
